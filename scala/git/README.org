this directory contains assorted [[http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks][git hooks]] (and other paraphernalia) which can
be used to automate and enforce some measure of regularity in the codebase. git
is cross-platform tool and as such you could potentially have hooks which are
platform agnostic. to not unnecessarily complicate matters, however, we've made
platform specific directories (currently only linux).
