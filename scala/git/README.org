this directory contains assorted [[http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks][git hooks]] (and other paraphernalia) which can
be used to automate and enforce some measure of regularity in the codebase. git
is cross-platform tool and as such you could potentially have hooks which are
platform agnostic. to not unnecessarily complicate matters, however, we've made
platform specific directories (currently only linux).

Note that the pre-commit hook expects to find the "command line" version of
Scalariform, which is available for download here:
